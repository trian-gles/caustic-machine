An AI accompaniment tool for use by a single performer.

# Usage
Requires Pure Data 0.50 with TimbreID, sigmund, bonk, and pdjs externals.

An input signal from the performer must come through channel 0.  This should not contain feedback from the output of the patch.

It can run in 4 channels or 2 channels.

Simply run main.pd, turn on DSP processing, and press the "on/off" toggle to begin.
